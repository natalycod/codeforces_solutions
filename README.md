# codeforces_solutions
It's repository with my old C++ code for Codeforces problems (codeforces.com). It exists to send it as an example of code I wrote.

The Codeforces is the site for solving competition programming problems. Some differences between programming competitions and product code are:
* on the programming competitions you need to solve the problem and write the code as fast as you can, so you don't usually have time to make it more neat with different paradigmas or something like that (but you can't write it dirty, because in this case you will never be able to debug it)
* you can send only one file for the problem, so it's impossible to divide code into several files with some logic.

Although it's a little bit different things, I think that it shows my ability to solve complex problems and utilise C++ for writing advanced algorithms and data structures

## File navigation

Every file is independent problem solution. Name of the file is the number and the name of the problem.

On the top of every file there are some comments about the problem:

* **Problem** - link to the problem description
* **Submission** - link to the successful submission of this exact code to the Codeforces platform
* **Problem overview** - Quick problem description, written by me
* **Data structures and algorithms usage** - names of data structures and algorithms I used to solve the problem
* **Time complexities** - time complexity of the whole problem solution or for the operations I needed to implement

Next lines are just code for the invented solution
