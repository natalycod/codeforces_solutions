# codeforces_solutions
It's repository with my old C++ code for Codeforces problems (codeforces.com). It exists to send it as an example of code I write.

The Codeforces is the site for solving competition programming problems. Some differences between programming competitions and product code are:
* on the programming competitions you need to solve the problem and write the code as fast as you can, so you don't usually have time to make it more neat with different paradigmas or something like that (but you can't write it dirty, because in this case you will never be able to debug it)
* you can send only one file for the problem, so it's impossible to divide code into several files with some logic.

## File navigation

Every file is independent problem solution. Name of the file is the number and the name of the problem.
Inside the file the first line is link for the problem description, the second - link for the successful submission of this exact code to the Codeforces site.
